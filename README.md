# hello-world
My very first Repository
Hi, I'm borges-code and I've been a teacher for eleven yers now, but recently, I decided to have a carreer change and what's best than coding, right?!
So, working really hard here to learn the basics in a proper, hands on way, so I can start on this path, being able to produce and deliver more!
The exciting news is, I'm loving it, every step of the way!!!
